# 50 days of Python
> 50 days of learning python. One commit at a time :smile:

This is a personal project where I document my daily doodles on `Python`. The reason I have this on `Github` is for social accountability.

Project is grouped into:

```bash

├── challenge
│   └── week wise packaging (e.g. week #1)
│       └── day wise script naming (e.g. 1_{concept}.py)
│       └── ...
├── misc 
│   ├── unstructured scripts 
│   └── ...
